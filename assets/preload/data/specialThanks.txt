WITH

bbpanzu - if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have posted that one chart that would change my life.
J8khero - without you I would have never gotten 5K Subs on YouTube, or even have a SINGLE friend group in the first place.
4mbr0s3 2 - You created the code that generated the 3d parts of the movement. Without you, The modcharts the audience sees in this mod will never be a reality. 

NomeDomeStudios and jarlungus - You helped me have the most perfect sprites of my characters. Ones I will cherish for my lifetime.
FoguDragon - You made HQ charts in such a pace I truly have no clue how. I praise your ability to do so.

AND

YOU.

This mod has been in production for nearly a year. With the constant ups and downs in the community, and
the amount of time it took to find just ONE artist, even if it never happened, things won't be any different due to
my inexperience in directing a mod. It was my first full week mod I have ever created and directed in my life.
The majority of the mod was made by only 4-5 people as an experimental passion project, and I rather keep it that way.
